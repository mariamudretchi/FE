This study introduces a research project that is focused around automating the process of feature engineering, highlighting how this step contributes to improving the performance of the machine learning models.
The hypothesis is supported by a practical implementation where two models were trained, one with and one without automatically generated features, using a complex dataset from Kaggle that contains official information for each game in the National Hockey League (NHL) over the past six years. The primary goal of the predictive model is to accurately identify standard season matches based on recorded game events. After interpreting the obtained results, it can be observed that the model utilizing the Deep Feature Synthesis algorithm for automatic feature generation demonstrates an overall improved performance compared to the general model.
